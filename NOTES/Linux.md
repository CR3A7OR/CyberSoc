# Linux Fundamentals

## SLIDE (1)

Linux is a operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system. Linux features many tools and commands available to help traverse across the terminal.

**Flags** - are options used to modify the behavior of a command
(-v shows a version || --help gets man page)

Using CLI requires much less CPU and memory from the computer, allowing low-power computers to cheaply run complex programs without having to waste time drawing everything for a user.
