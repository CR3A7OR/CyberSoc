	- Windows Compile - `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe -static -lm 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110.c -o 33d07246373a77e2c05346ebbe17f110.exe`

---- SOLUTION ----
» Intended Setup
	1. Analyse Dossier to find
		» Recognise Logo
		» Recognise Accomplice Photo
		» Recognise File hash matches executable
	2. Run Executable to find:
		» Recognise Cr0w3 Name
		» Recognise Github hint
		» Recognise version number
	3. Search CROW3 on Github and see matching Profile Pic
	4. Find the matching CYB3R_CR0W3_G3N3RAT0R.c which has same version and md5 hash for name (but removed flag variable)
		» CROW3INC Distributable Folders
		» Other codes and files can be a distraction
	5. Inside commit history of CYB3R_CR0W3_G3N3RAT0R.c find a removed print statement saying "Follow us at @Cr0w3Inc" 
		» Another commit with flag variable saying "Nice Try"
	6. Find Youtube Video that way, recognise hint its from General Aragorn 
		» Aragorn full of code that is a dead end and false flags
	7. About section of Youtube channel has pubert's email which can be linked to Luxus by looking at Closed Issues in Git
	8. Luxus account dumped with fake codes and flags 

» Unconventional Solutions
	1. BruteForce
	   » Iterate the exe for 10 million iterations
	2. Reverse Engineer
	   » Use cutter / ghidra / ida to trace operation
	   » Find contents of sec variable which is key and length with keyLen
	   » Acquire hexadecimal of encrypted flag and apply XOR with (flag,sec,26,keyLen) to decrypt
